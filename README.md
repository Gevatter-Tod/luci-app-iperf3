# luci-app-iperf3
Small footprint Luci app for iperf3.

It allows iperf3 to be launched as server or client through the Luci Openwrt web interface.
It is written in JavaScript and aims to be very small, so it can also fit on devices with little storage.

**Installation:**
You currently need to manually copy the files onto the OpenWRT router.
A opkg package is wip.
